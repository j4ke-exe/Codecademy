# Question:
# Create a function named divisible_by_ten() that takes a list of numbers named nums as a parameter.
# Return the count of how many numbers in the list are divisible by 10.

# Solution:
def divisible_by_ten(nums):
   count = 0
   for num in nums:
      if (num % 10 == 0):
         count += 1
   return count
print(divisible_by_ten([20, 25, 30, 35, 40]))

# Output = 3
